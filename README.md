# Andriod-app-with-cpanel-login-page
Login authentication page for an Android app with cpanel web-hosting using back-end Java and PHP on server side  

This is a very simple application that checks the credential of the user. I am using a cpanel web hosting with MYSQL data base.
The queries to the data base are written in PHP. Please see the conn.PHP and login.PHP. 
These files need to be on the server side (for cpanel it will be public_html folder).
